qaul.net on OpenWRT devices
===========================

As qaul.net creates an olsrd 10.x.x.x IPv4 network. OpenWRT routers can
easily extend and participate in the network. Therefore any OpenWRT 
router can easily be configured to interoperate with qaul.net. 

For ease of use and because many routers don't have enough flash memory
we created a preconfigured OpenWRT image.

To build a custom preconfigured OpenWRT image for your router follow the 
instructions in the file BUILD_CUSTOM_IMAGE.md
