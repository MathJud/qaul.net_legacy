qaul.net on OpenWRT devices
===========================

As qaul.net creates an olsrd 10.x.x.x IPv4 network. OpenWRT routers can 
extend and participate in the network. Therefore any OpenWRT 
router can be configured to interoperate with qaul.net. 

For ease of use and because many routers don't have enough flash memory
we created a preconfigured OpenWRT image.

To build a custom preconfigured OpenWRT image for your router follow the 
instructions in the file README_BUILD-CUSTOM-IMAGE.md


Warning
-------

The OpenWRT port and the GUI are still work in progress and not yet 
generic for every device. 

Our test devices are:

* TP-Link TL-MR3020
* TP-Link TL-WR842
