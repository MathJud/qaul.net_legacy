qaul.net Legacy repository
==========================

**This repository contains the old and outdated version of qaul.net. The 
current development is happening in the  
[ repository qaul.net ](https://github.com/WachterJud/qaul.net)**


**qaul.net** implements a redundant, open communication principle, in which wireless-enabled computers and mobile devices can directly form a spontaneous network. Chat functions, file sharing and voice chat is possible independent of internet and cellular networks. Because qaul.net creates an instant ad-hoc mesh network, you can do anything you want over it, and is not hindered by the feature set of the qaul.net user interface.
